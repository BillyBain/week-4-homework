## week-4-homework

This week for homework I had to make a coding quiz.
The quiz uses multiple choice questions to test ones knowledge.
By answering correctly you move on to the next question.
The score is determined by the time remaining when finished.
Speed is an important factor beware wrong answers will subtract time.

The challenges I faced were sequencing my functions properties at the correct timings, pulling
the score and making it easy to read, and fine tuning the code.
